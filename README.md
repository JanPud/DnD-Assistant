# DnD-Assistant
An app for tracking combat state and character stats in custom DnD setting.
## Home Fragment
Allows user to host their game using P2P model. App uses Nearby Connections from Google, which means it requires enabling location service to work properly. The location service is only used to find and maitain the connection with the host, the protocol using it can optimize connections parameters by using location. Connected devices can request Battle State from the host and update it as the game goes on.

If so desired application can be used in 'offline' mode.
